# Budi's CS:GO Config

This is my constantly updated CS:GO autoexec config. Changelogs can be found under revisions [here](https://gist.github.com/nickbudi/3916475/revisions?diff=split) 

Put *autoexec.cfg* in `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg` or take what you want from it and add to your autoexec config! 

After the Wild West Simulator 2015 update, *video.txt* needs to be put in `...\Steam\userdata\<Steam3 ID>\730\local\cfg`

### Launch Options

	-novid -high -threads 4 -freq 144 -refresh 144 -tickrate 128 -maxplayers_override 50 -nojoy -nod3d9ex1 +exec autoexec.cfg
